# Documentation Page Project

## Project Overview

This project consists of a simple HTML documentation page styled using a custom CSS file. The page features a fixed navigation bar on the left, allowing users to navigate through different sections of the document easily. Each section is organized with a header and accompanying content.

## Files Included

- **doc page.html**: The main HTML file that structures the documentation page.
- **doc page.css**: The CSS file used to style the HTML document.

## Features

1. **Fixed Navigation Bar**:
    - Located on the left side of the page, this bar stays fixed as you scroll through the document, allowing easy access to different sections.
    - The navigation links correspond to different sections of the document.

2. **Responsive Design**:
    - The layout adjusts for screens with a height less than 600px, where the font size of the main content sections is reduced to enhance readability.

3. **Main Content Area**:
    - Contains five sections, each marked with a header and paragraphs for content.
    - Each section is accessible via the navigation bar.

## Usage

1. Open `doc page.html` in a web browser to view the documentation page.
2. Navigate between sections using the links provided in the left-hand navigation bar.
3. The CSS styles in `doc page.css` will be automatically applied when the HTML file is opened.

## Customization

- **Adding New Sections**:
    - To add a new section, create a new `<section>` element in the HTML file, give it a unique `id`, and update the navigation bar with a corresponding link.
  
- **Modifying Styles**:
    - You can update `doc page.css` to customize the appearance of the page, including colors, fonts, and layout.
